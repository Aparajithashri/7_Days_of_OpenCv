"""
1st argument is the source image, which should be a grayscale image.
2nd argument is the threshold value which is used to classify the pixel values.
3rd argument is the maxVal which represents the value to be given if pixel value is more than (sometimes less than) the threshold value.
4th argument is the different types of threshold.
